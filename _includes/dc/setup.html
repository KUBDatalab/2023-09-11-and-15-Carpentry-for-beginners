Before the workshop, please make sure you have installed OpenRefine. The installation instructions can be found at https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/installing. 
You will also need to install DB Browser for SQlite, found at https://datacarpentry.org/sql-socialsci/. 
<strong>If you need help with the installation, drop by the KUB Datalab, at Copenhagen University Library, North Campus, Nørre Allé 49, any Wednesday between 12:30 pm and 02:00 pm.</strong>
