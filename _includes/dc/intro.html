  <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills you'll need to manage data throughout your studies. The target audience is students who have little to no prior computational experience, 
 and the skills taught during the workshop can be applied in all disciplines where you work with data in sheets. You will quickly be able to apply what you have learned in your own projects.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another.
